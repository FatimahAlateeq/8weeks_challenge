#### What is this project?
I'm practicing my skills in different data engineering tools that I have learned. I learned Excel, Python, SQL, R, and I might use more tools. I'm challenging myself to do the '8 Week SQL Challenge' from https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/ in each tool I have.

#### Analytics based on what?
I analyze based on the challenges questions to answer all of them. I could show some of my personal skills in some tools as addition.

#### References
